# Voice Analytics

A lightweight web app for visualizing and analyzing call data through beautiful, interactive charts. Built with tools I love working with — React, Supabase, and a modern UI stack that keeps everything fast and fun to build.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### **Frontend**

- **React** — My go-to choice for any frontend project. I’ve spent a lot of time with it, and it fits perfectly for building dynamic, component-based dashboards like this.
- **TypeScript** — I’m actively getting better at TypeScript. It helps me write cleaner, more reliable code, and I’ve been using this project to push that learning further.
- **Vite** — My favorite build tool. It’s fast, simple, and makes local development feel instant. I honestly can’t go back to anything slower.

### **State Management**

- **React `useState`** — Keeping it simple. The app doesn’t need complex state management, and `useState` does the job perfectly without adding unnecessary overhead.

### **Charting**

- **Chart.js** & **Recharts** — Both serve different needs here: Recharts for quick, clean charts, and Chart.js when I want finer control. I like having the flexibility of both. ChatGPT also recommended these. So.

### **Backend**

- **Supabase** — Easy to set up, integrates nicely with React, and gives me a fast way to store and fetch user-specific data without dealing with backend boilerplate.

### **UI / Styling**

- **shadcn/ui** — I love this library. It gives me elegant, pre-built components that I can still customize however I like. It’s made the UI side of this project a joy to work on.
- **Tailwind CSS** — My favorite way to style. It’s fast, consistent, and works beautifully with shadcn. I can design and tweak layouts directly in the markup without jumping between files.

### **Animation**

- **Framer Motion** — I added it for subtle transitions and animations that make the UI feel alive and polished. It’s simple to use but adds a lot to the overall experience.

This project is a mix of tools I’m comfortable with and a few I’m intentionally learning deeper. The stack keeps development smooth, the UI modern, and the experience genuinely enjoyable to build and use.
